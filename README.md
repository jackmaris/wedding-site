**Q: Why build this site instead of using a service?**

A: Mostly for fun. Partially for flexibility-- we wanted the registry to be any
link on the internet, not just links from specific registry sites.

**Q: What is it using?**

A: It's using Deno with the
[Fresh framework](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/introduction). It's a server-side
render framework with a React-like syntax, and it mostly works fine for such a
simple app. I'm storing data using a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) Postgres
instance. And Google Drive for assets, of course.

**Q: Are there any Easter eggs on the site?**

A: No, of course not. No way. Not a chance.

**Q: Can I submit a pull request?**

A: Be my guest.
